## Module for hackerrank.com tasks Algorithms solutions

###Warmup

#### 4. _testVeryBigSum()_ is the solution for _A Very Big Sum task._
Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

#### 5. _SquareMatrixMission_ and _testDiagonalDifference()_ is the solution for _Diagonal Difference task._
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

#### 6. _Plus Minus task_.
Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. 
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.
You must print the following  lines:

A decimal representing of the fraction of positive numbers in the array compared to its size.
A decimal representing of the fraction of negative numbers in the array compared to its size.
A decimal representing of the fraction of zeros in the array compared to its size.

#### 7. _Staircase_
   #
  ##
 ###
####
Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size n. 

#### 8. Mini-Max Sum
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

###Implementation

#### Grading Students

At HackerLand University, a passing grade is any grade 40 points or higher on a 100 point scale. Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student’s grade according to the following rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next higher multiple of 5 is less than 3, round to the next higher multiple of 5
If the grade is less than 38, don’t bother as it’s still a failing grade
Automate the rounding process then round a list of grades and print the results.
